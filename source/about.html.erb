<h2>About Habitat</h2>

<h3>Habitat International</h3>

<p>
  Habitat for Humanity International is a worldwide, nonprofit, and ecumenical Christian housing ministry that believes that every man, woman, and child should have a safe, decent, and affordable place to live. Habitat partners with lower income families to build homes they can purchase. Homes are built and repaired using volunteer labor and donations. The homes are sold at the cost of construction and mortgaged with zero-interest loans. The three primary criteria for selection are housing need, ability to pay, and the potential for being a good Habitat partner.
