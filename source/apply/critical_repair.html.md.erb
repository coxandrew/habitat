## Critical Repair

Critical repair is a relatively new addition to the activities of HFHP. Through Habitat Powhatan’s ‘critical repair’ program, our volunteers perform a host of repairs for residents in the county who cannot afford or complete the much needed repairs themselves. This program was initiated in 2011 to address home repairs that are considered critical to the structural integrity, safely, or utility of the home. Repairs must be beyond the capacity of the homeowner to accomplish without assistance.

Candidates for critical repairs must:

* Own and live in a single family home in Powhatan County.
* Have homeowner’s insurance.

The estimate for materials and subcontractor costs for the repair generally cannot exceed $1500. Typical repairs include roof repair or replacement, window or door replacement, and the addition of handicapped access to the home.

If you are in need of such assistance, and meet the qualifications, contact Terry Paquette (Executive Director) at hfh.powhatan@gmail.com or 794-1700.
