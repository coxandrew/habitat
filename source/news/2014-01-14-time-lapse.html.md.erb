Enthusiastic Habitat volunteer, Jim Dempsey, joined us late last year with his new camera to take pictures of the crew putting the trusses up on home #9. The camera takes a picture every minute or so and when they are combined it plays like a video in fast motion. If you have ever wondered what a typical work day looks like, please watch the 2 minute video where, right before your eyes, the trusses go up at break neck speed. Thanks Jim!
