The annual public meeting, which was another huge success, was held on November 13 at The Mill at Fine Creek. We very much appreciate the generosity of Lisa Benusa and all the fine folks at the Mill who once again hosted our event.

Over 40 attendees heard presentations on our 2012-2013 accomplishments and our goals for the coming year. Many accomplishments were highlighted including the completion of homes 8 and 9, the many families weâ€™ve touched through our critical repair program, the new brochure and website, and the solid financial situation our affiliate enjoys because of our success in raising funds from donors like the Green Foundation.

Two of our goals for the next year include selecting families for homes 10 and 11 and engaging more Powhatan churches in our efforts.

Special recognition was given to the many sponsors and donors who supported us in the past year.

To cap off the evening we heard an emotional tribute from homeowner Shy Southard about the positive changes Habitat can have in the lives of the people we touch.
