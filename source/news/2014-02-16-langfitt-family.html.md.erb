Habitat is pleased to announce that the Langfitt family has been selected for home #10.
The family has been renting a home on Goodwyn Road for the past nine years. Gerry is an electrician for a firm in Ashland and Amanda has worked at the Powhatan Animal Hospital for the past eleven years. They have two children. Autumn attends Powhatan Junior High School and Jonathan is a student at Pocahontas Elementary. The family attends Open Door Baptist Church. The Langfitts know that it pays to be persistent when you want something badly enough. The family had applied to Habitat three times before being selected. As they say, the third time’s the charm!

The lot that the Langfitts have chosen is a private, wooded lot on Cartersville Road. It is one of two that were donated by Gail and Reed Schweickert. The house, driveway, and septic have been designed and laid out and the clearing of the lot has started. The Langfitt home will be part of our first “blitz build”. The goal of this blitz build will be to dry in the house during a two week period from March 15 through March 29. If you would like to join in the fun, please call Habitat Powhatan at 794-1700.
