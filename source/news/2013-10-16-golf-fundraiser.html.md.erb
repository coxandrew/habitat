Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan held its 11th Annual Golf Tournament fundraiser on Friday, October 11 at Mill Quarter Plantation Golf Club. Thanks to the generosity of sponsors, players, and volunteers, the event raised $6,000 to help build low income housing in Powhatan County. Over 50 golfers showed up on this misty day to play golf, enjoy good food, fellowship, and have a chance at numerous raffle prizes.

This year, the tournament was fortunate to have Jay Woodson, PGA professional, as a participant. Jay also gave a brief putting lesson before the shotgun start. Volunteers handled registration, cooked hamburgers and hot dogs, drove the beverage cart, and performed other duties. Prizes included a weekend at Wintergreen with activity passes, two tickets to the Greenbrier Classic PGA Tournament next spring, dinner for eight at Brio Tuscan Grill, and golf for groups at The Foundry, Bay Creek, Virginia Beach National, Golden Horseshoe, and several others.

Don Whitley, President of the local Habitat affiliate said, “Habitat Powhatan is extremely grateful to the Powhatan community for its generosity in helping families that need just a little help to get them moving in a positive direction again.” He is planning for an even bigger and better tournament next year.
