Habitat Powhatan is about to experience its first “blitz build”! Once the foundation for the home is constructed, volunteers from Powhatan Community Church, led by Charlie Towler, will join forces with the Langfitt family for the “blitz build”. This is a Habitat term where a large number of volunteers work on the home over a short period of time to accomplish a lot. The goal of this blitz build is to dry in the house within just a two week period between March 15 and March 29. This means that volunteers will construct the subfloor, put up the exterior and interior walls, put on the trusses and sheathing, and then finish up by installing the windows and doors. If you’d like to join in the fun, please call Habitat Powhatan at 794-1700.

An interesting side note is that all of the walls for the Langfitt home have already been built. They were constructed by Chester Community Church in a Crossroads Mission project in 2012. The volunteers from the church built the walls in their church parking lot. They were then shipped to Powhatan and stored in one of RC Goodwyn’s warehouses. This is the third time that Habitat has used walls constructed in this way which saves both time and money. But the real blessing is that every church member wrote their favorite scripture on the walls during the dedication. God will definitely be in this Habitat home.
