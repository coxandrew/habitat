Habitat Powhatan is pleased to announce that we have relaunched our website! You will notice that it has a completely new look, feel and design. We hope that you will find it easier to navigate and to get the information you need about Habitat. The website will be updated frequently with new pictures, news articles, and announcements of upcoming events. We hope you will enjoy the new features of habitatpowhatan.org!

Special thanks to Andrew Cox, a native of Midlothian, Virginia and a James Madison University graduate, for donating his time to develop this website. Andrew has been building websites for over fifteen years and is currently living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as a Sr. Software Developer for Forever.com.
