The Screaming Eagles Academy of Martial Arts held a kick-a-thon at the Black Hawk Gym on Anderson Highway April 13. Coach Kevin Singler challenged each of his students to maximize the number of kicks made in a set period of time. From pledges secured by Coach Singler and his students, over $6000 was raised to benefit Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan.

Spectators were also treated to a demonstration of some the martial arts skills of the students. However, the fundraising effort was a clear demonstration that that the Academy emphasizes not only the athletic maneuvers of martial arts, but the building of character. The money raised by the Screaming Eagles will be used by HFHP to construct new homes and make critical home repairs throughout Powhatan.  HFHP is extremely grateful for the support of the Screaming Eagles Academy of Martial Arts.
