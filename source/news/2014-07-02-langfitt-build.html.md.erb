The Langfitt home is being completed faster than any other home we have built so far because of the good work of Powhatan Community Church and our other partners. In just four Saturdays, the home was completely dried in. Since then, churches from the Bon Air Friends of Habitat including Congregation Or Ami, Mt. Pisgah UMC, Church of the Epiphany, and Redeemer Lutheran have completed much of the work. We would also like to thank our contractor friends Erin Hill Maintenance, Humphrey Electric, Bobby Hathaway HVAC, Zaun Plumbing, Steve Carlisle Painting, and VMAC for donating their time on this house as well.

As we finish up the Langfitt home, the Bailey home is just getting started in Holly Hills. Join us if youâ€™d like to help. Call Terry Paquette at 794-1700.
