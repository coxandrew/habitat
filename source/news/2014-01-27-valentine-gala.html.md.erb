Habitat Powhatan has teamed up with the Free Clinic of Powhatan to host a night of romance at our first annual Valentine Gala. Bring your sweetheart out for a night of fun to [The Mill at Fine Creek](http://www.themillatfinecreek.com/). Plan to dance the night away to the music of [Jim Wray](http://www.jimwrayjazz.com/) and his band. You can reserve a table of 8 or 10 or come as a couple to meet your friends at The Mill. It will be the talk of the town and all for a good cause!
