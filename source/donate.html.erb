<h2>Donate</h2>

<p>
Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan (HFHP) depends upon donations from individuals, corporations, churches and civic groups, grants from charitable organizations, and fundraisers such as our annual golf tournament. HFHP is grateful for donations of cash, land, and new construction materials. Because HFHP is a 501(C)(3) organization, gifts qualify for all tax deductions allowed by the IRS for charitable contributions. If you have questions or would like to make a donation, contact Terry Paquette, Executive Director, at hfh.powhatan@gmail.com or (804) 794-1700.

<h3>Ways to Donate to Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan</h3>

<h4>Cash</h4>
<p>
Cash donations can be mailed to HFHP at this address:<br/>
Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan<br/>
P.O. Box 416<br/>
Powhatan, VA 23139<br/>
</p>

<h4>Fundraisers</h4>

<p>Fundraisers are a way that your group can raise donations for HFHP. An example of a group fundraiser is the kick-a-thon that was held by The Screaming Eagles Academy of Martial Arts at the Black Hawk Gym on April 13, 2013. The participants collected pledges and then earned funds depending on how many kicks were made in a set period of time. (See photo at the bottom of this page).</p>

<h4>Land</h4>
<p>Low cost acquisition of land is critical to the productivity of Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan (HFHP).  The market value of building lots in Powhatan is approximately 40% of the cost of building the home.  It would not be possible for HFHP to maintain its ambitious building schedule without acquiring building lots at an average cost well below market value. In the past, a combination of land gifts and purchases at tax sale auctions has made this possible.</p>

<p>The Powhatan Board of Supervisors has recognized the importance of land donation to organizations such as HFHP.  In 2004, the BOS approved the division of one parcel of land for conveyance to an organization holding a valid 501(c)(3) designation from the Internal Revenue Service.  Thus, any other rights for division that the land owner may have are not diminished by the gift.</p>

<p>HFHP will continue to depend upon the generosity of landowners to keep its average lot cost low.  Please consider supporting Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan by a land gift.</p>

<h4>Construction Materials</h4>
<p>HFHP accepts donations of new construction materials. Other Habitat affiliates have ReStores where they sell used materials but Powhatan does not. If you are remolding and would like to donate used building materials please call the Metro Richmond Habitat ReStore at 804-228-1305 and they will gladly accept them.</p>

<h4>Matching Gifts</h4>
<p>Many companies offer matching gift programs to encourage employees to contribute to charitable organizations. Some companies provide matching funds to support employee volunteer hours. Most of these programs match contributions dollar for dollar, and some will even double or triple the amount of your gift. Please check with your company to see if it offers a matching gift program that will match your gift or volunteer hours.</p>

<h4>Honor or Memorial Gifts</h4>
<p>You may pay tribute to your loved ones with an honor or memorial gift. Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan will send a greeting card to your loved ones in recognition of your gift.</p>

<h4>Planned Giving</h4>
<p>You can leave HFHP a gift in your will or name Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy, charitable trust, or annuity.</p>
