      Volunteers and homeowners celebrate the completion of the second wheelchair ramp.

<p>Habitat was recently informed by the Rabon family that an extensive wheelchair ramp at their home was no longer needed. The unfortunate passing of Dick Rabon, a longtime Powhatan resident, was the reason the ramps were available. Gladys, Dick’s wife, was hoping the ramps could be used to help others and that’s exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Through Habitat Powhatan’s ‘critical repair’ program, our volunteers do a host of repairs for residents in the county who cannot afford or complete the much needed repairs themselves. This includes residents who need wheelchair ramps. At the time, Habitat knew of three ramps that were needed but not yet built.</p>

<p>Habitat sent word out to our volunteers and many were eager to help. First, two very large and heavy ramps were removed from the Rabon home. Once removed, volunteers worked to make the home look like it did before the ramps were installed. The pieces were then taken to the three homes in the county where the new ramps would be built. The following week, they began to build a ramp at a home on Jefferson Landing Road using both the Rabon ramp and new materials donated by Gladys Rabon. The week after that, additional volunteers built a ramp at a home on Hearthstone Lane again using both used and new materials. The third ramp is now under construction at a home off Dorset Road.</p>

<p>Volunteers agreed it was a pleasure to see the happy faces on the ramp recipients. And none of this would have happened if it weren’t for the generosity and forward thinking of Gladys Rabon who wanted to help her neighbors and honor her late husband Dick. Thanks Gladys!</p>
