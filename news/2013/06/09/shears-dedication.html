<p>There is nothing more rewarding than attending a home dedication for a family. On Sunday, June 9, 2013, Habitat for Humanity - Powhatan (HFHP) did just that! We dedicated our 9th home, which will be home to Diane Shears and her children Charles, Aliyah, and Camille. The setting for this home is one of my personal favorites. It is on a nice, big lot on Cartersville Road opposite a beautiful horse farm!</p>

<p>Diane, Charles and Aliyah learned so much during this build. Charles wants to design and build his own home one day so he just soaked in all that he could. It was such a pleasure to see him learn new skills that he will use in the future.</p>

<p>Attending the ceremony were Dianeâ€™s parents, who live in New York City, and several of her friends and co-workers. Also attending were our two most recent homeowners, Shy Southard and Brigid Lanzillotti, their families, and a number of HFHP board members.</p>

<p>As is customary, the Shears family was presented a family Bible, a bottle of wine, a loaf of bread, and a box of salt. A prayer was said asking God to be present with the family and to guide them through this new chapter in their life. A wonderful tray of desserts and drinks were enjoyed by all and everybody in attendance was able to walk through the house and see the finished product.</p>
